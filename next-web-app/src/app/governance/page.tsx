          The Ilios token uses a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) as
          its governance structure, which means that token holders can
          participate in decision-making through a decentralized voting process.
          To vote on proposals, token holders would need to stake their Ilios
          tokens to receive voting power. The more tokens a holder stakes, the
          more voting power they have. Proposals for changes to the Ilios
          project can be submitted by anyone in the community. Once a proposal
          is submitted, it is reviewed by the DAO's governance team to ensure
          that it meets the project's requirements and aligns with the project's
          vision. If the proposal is approved, it is then presented to the
          community for a vote. Token holders are able to vote on proposals
          using their voting power. The voting process is conducted using a
          secure and transparent blockchain-based system, which ensures that the
          voting results are tamper-proof and auditable. Once the voting period
          is over, the results are tallied and the proposal is either accepted
          or rejected. To ensure that the voting process is fair and
          transparent, the Ilios project may also use a form of quadratic
          voting. This means that the voting power of each token holder is not
          directly proportional to the number of tokens they hold, but instead
          follows a quadratic curve. This helps to prevent large token holders
          from dominating the voting process and ensures that all token holders
          have an equal say in decision-making. Overall, the decentralized
          voting process for the Ilios token ensures that decision-making is
          transparent, democratic, and aligned with the interests of the
          community. By using a DAO and a blockchain-based voting system, the
          Ilios project can create a governance structure that is resistant to
          manipulation and ensures that decisions are made in the best interests
          of all stakeholders.
